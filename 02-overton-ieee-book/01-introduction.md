# 01 - Introduction

* **Numerical Computing:**
    * Computing with numbers

* **History of computational devices**:
    * **1650 B.C.:** Rhind Papyrus
    * Abacus in Europe until **beginning of 13th century**
    * **Beginning of 13th Century:** introduction in Europe of th positional<br>
    decimal notation from the Middle East
    * **End of 16th Century:** positional decimal notation standard in<br>
    Europe, due to computational convenience
    * **Beginning of 17th Century:** tabulation of logarithms, John Napier
    * **17th Century:** Newton, developed numerical techniques,<br>
    including Calculus
    * **18th and 19th Centuries:**  Euler, Lagrange, Gauss

    * **Physical Computational Devices:**
        * Abacus
        * Slide Rule ("Régua de Cálculo")
            * Napier studies of logarithms
            * Greatly used from the middle of 19th century until 1975<br>
            obsolete by cheap electronic calculators
        * Mechanical calculating machines
            * Schickard, Pascal, Leibnitz
                * 17th Century
        * Programmable machine
            * Charles Babbage, 19th century
                * Ideas way ahead of its time
        * Groups of calculating persons during World War II
            * Groups of people manually computing
            * Roots of parallel computing

* **Computer Age:**
    * **Z3**
        * Konrad Zuse in 1939-1941
        * Binary floating point numbers
    * **Colossus**
        * British government
        * Code-breaking machine during World War II
    * **ENIAC:**
        * University of Pennsylvania in 1943-1945
