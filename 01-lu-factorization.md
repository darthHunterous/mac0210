* **Triangular Matrix:**
    * Upper/Lower if all elements above/below the main diagonal are zero


* **Diagonal Matrix:**
    * All elements outside the main diagonal are zero


* **LU Factorization without pivoting:**
    * A = LU
    * L is lower triangular, U is upper triangular
* **LU Factorization with row pivoting:**
    * A = PLU
    * P is the permutation matrix
        * Where only one element per column is "1" and others are all "0"
